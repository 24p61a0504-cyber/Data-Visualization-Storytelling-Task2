## 📂 Steps Taken
1. **Imported the Dataset**  
   Loaded Superstore.csv into Power BI/Tableau for cleaning and visualization.

2. **Explored the Data**  
   Understood key fields such as Sales, Profit, Order Date, Category, Region, Segment, and Ship Mode.

3. **Created Visualizations**  
   Built multiple charts including:
   - Sales by Region  
   - Sales vs Profit scatter plot  
   - Sales by Category  
   - Profit by Sub-Category  
   - Monthly Sales Trend  
   - Top & Bottom performing products  
   - Ship Mode analysis  

4. **Applied Data Storytelling Principles**  
   - Used minimal and consistent colors  
   - Highlighted important insights  
   - Added context through titles and annotations  
   - Focused on business outcomes rather than visuals only  

5. **Built Final Dashboard**  
   Designed a clean and interactive dashboard showing KPIs and insights:
   - Total Sales  
   - Total Profit  
   - Number of Orders  
   - Profit Ratio  
   The layout follows best practices: KPIs on top, main visuals in the center, filters on the side.

6. **Exported Report**  
   Exported the dashboard as PDF and added screenshots to this repository.

## 📈 Summary of Insights
Here are the major findings from the data:

- **Technology** is the highest revenue-generating category.  
- **Office Supplies** sells well but yields low profit margins.  
- Some sub-categories like **Tables** generate high sales but show **negative profit**, indicating discount issues.  
- The **West region** performs the best in both sales and profit.  
- There is a clear **upward trend in monthly sales**, especially during year-end.  
- **Standard Class** is the most commonly used shipping mode.  

These insights can help optimize discount strategies, product focus, and regional marketing efforts.
